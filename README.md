== What's this ==
 - mongo_bench.sh
   You can get the benchmark of the local MongoDB

 - How to use
   1. Setup local MongoDB in /usr/local/mongo.
       This script is requiring the PID file at /usr/local/mongo/logs/mongod.pid
       You can also use mongod.conf

   2. Build mongo_bench.
       type "make" at this directory.
       See "How to build" for details

   3. Run mongo_bench_mini.sh
       This bench is treating 400 MB data.
       First of all, you should run mongo_bench_mini.sh for test.

   4. Run mongo_bench.sh
       This bench is treating 40 GB data.
       But it will continue to run more than a overnight.

== Ease to try this ==
  make prepare
  make test
  ./mongo_bench_mini.sh


== Outputs ==
[insert]
 Below outputs means,
  Inserted 1000,000 around 400 bytes documents from 10 threads.
  - It tooks 47.8652 seconds.
  - mongod used 124.872 CPU in avarage.
  - mongod could store 20892 documents per seconds.
  - Client sends 385000000 bytes data.
  - Actually,mongod saved 408000000 bytes data.
  - Throuput was 7.67081 MB per seconds
